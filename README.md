Kami is a Japanese term that describes the spirits or gods of Shinto beliefs, as well as the deities of complementary religions. Followers of Japanese and Korean religions believed that the pursuit of self-perfection in mind, body, and spirit, would lead them into Nirvana, their realm of salvation.

Kami is a foundational tool for individuals interested in pursuing their best self; a scheduling app for organizing all activities pertaining to mind, body, and spirit.
